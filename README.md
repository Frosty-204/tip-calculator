### What I learned

I really gone through much here ðŸ˜…, looping through the tip buttons and toggeling the states was kinda weird for me, not to mention how i tried to give up when i didn't know how to seperate the custom tip from the tip buttons. So it was actually quite a decent challange for a beginner like me.
